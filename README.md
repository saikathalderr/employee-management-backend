## Back-end application build with TypeGraphQL & TypeScript

**How to run it?**
 - First clone two repo, the [this](https://github.com/saikathalderr/employee-management-backend) & [front-end](https://github.com/saikathalderr/employee-management-client)
 - once you clone, run `yarn` or `npm install` on both repos.
 - now that you installed all the dependencies, you need to run the codes, first run the back-end by `yarn dev` (it will run on http://localhost:4000 by default)
 - then run the front-end by same command `yarn dev` (it will run on http://127.0.0.1:5174 by default)
 - that's it, now just open the front end address on your browser & play with it.
